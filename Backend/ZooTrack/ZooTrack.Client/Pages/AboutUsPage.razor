            <p>
                ZooTrack was founded with a passion for wildlife and a vision to leverage cutting-edge technology for its protection. We recognized the growing need for efficient and non-invasive methods to monitor animals in their natural habitats and in controlled environments. Starting as a small team of dedicated engineers and conservationists, we embarked on a journey to develop a system that could accurately identify and track various animal species using advanced camera and AI technologies.
